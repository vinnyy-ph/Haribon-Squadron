<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## üí° About The Project

This repository contains the source code for Haribon Squadrons, a space Alien-like game themed around Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM). Developed as a submission for our finals project in the course Computer Architecture and Organization, this game showcases our skills in x86 assembly language programming and our creativity.

  <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block">‚öô Technology Used</h2></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Assembly Language: The game is written entirely in x86 assembly language, showcasing our ability to program at a low level.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assembler: We used Turbo Assembler to compile our assembly code.
    </li>
    <li>
      For testing and running the game, we used DOSBox to emulate the x86 environment.
    </li>

  </ol>
